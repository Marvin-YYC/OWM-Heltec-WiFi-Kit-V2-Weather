OpenWeatherMap Heltec WiFi Kit V2 
Another Open Weather Map
Credit and Thanks to Johann Brochier for original code which I altered for my needs: https://github.com/JohannBro/OpenWeatherMap-WIFI-KIT-32
I have added my PlatfromIO sketch as well.  Hope I did it all right :)

FYI: The coiled copper wire at the top right is a DIY external antenna.  
The Heltec boards have a notoriously poor on-board antenna. The copper wire greatly improves range, especially helpful with ESP-Now projects.
